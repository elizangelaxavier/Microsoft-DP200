# DP 200 - Implementing a Data Platform Solution
# Lab 8 - Securing Azure Data Platforms

**Estimated Time**: 75 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read. It is assumed that the content and lab for module 1 to module 7 has been completed.

**Lab files**: The files for this lab are located in the _Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.8_ folder.

## Lab overview

The students will be able to describe and document the different approaches to security that can be taken to provide defence in depth. This will involve the student documenting the security that has been set up so far in the course. It will also enable the students to identify any gaps in security that may exists for AdventureWorks.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Explain Security
1. Describe key security components
1. Secure Storage Accounts and Data Lake Storage
1. Secure Data Stores
1. Secure Streaming Data

## Scenario
  
As a senior data engineer within AdventureWorks, you are responsible for ensuring that your data estate is secured. You are performing a security check of your current infrastructure to ensure that you have diligently placed security where it is required. This check should be a holistic check of all the services and data that you have created so far, and an identification of any gaps that there may be in the configuration of the security. 

You have also been asked to tighten up the security of the SQL Database DeptDatabasesxx and have been asked to setup auditing against the database so that you can monitor access to the database. Furthermore, you have learned that that the Manage permission for your event hub is not restrictive enough, and you want to remove this permission.

At the end of this lad, you will have:

1. Explained Security
1. Described key security components
1. Secured Storage Accounts and Data Lake Storage
1. Secured Data Stores
1. Secured Streaming Data

> **IMPORTANT**: As you go through this lab, make a note of any issue(s) that you have encountered in any provisioning or configuration tasks and log it in the table in the document located at _\Labfiles\DP-200-Issues-Doc.docx_. Document the Lab number, note the technology, Describe the issue, and what was the resolution. Save this document as you will refer back to it in a later module.

## Exercise 1: An introduction to security

Estimated Time: 15 minutes
