# DP 200 - Implementing a Data Platform Solution
# Lab 7 - Orchestrating Data Movement with Azure Data Factory

**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read. It is assumed that the content and lab for module 1: Azure for the Data Engineer has also been completed

**Lab files**: The files for this lab are located in the _Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.7_ folder.

## Lab overview

In this module, students will learn how Azure Data factory can be used to orchestrate the data movement from a wide range of data platform technologies. They will be able to explain the capabilities of the technology and be able to set up an end to end data pipeline that ingests data from SQL Database and load the data into SQL Data Warehouse. The student will also demonstrate how to call a compute resource.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Explain data streams and event processing
1. Data Ingestion with Event Hubs
1. Processing Data with Stream Analytics Jobs

## Scenario
  
After performing the initial population of the Data Warehouse into Azure SQL Data Warehouse, the information services department want to automate this process. You have been asked to support the information services department in developing a solution that can automate the movement of data from Azure SQL Database.

Your solution should be able to perform full copy of  [SalesLT].[ProductCategory] and [SalesLT].[ProductDescription] transaction table that act as dimension tables of the same name in your Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Furthermore, the solution should also follow best practices of loading into a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) system using Azure Data Factory as the orchestrator of the data movements.

In addition, the Data Scientists have asked to confirm if Azure Databricks can be called from Azure Data Factory. To that end, you will create a simple proof of concept Data Factory pipeline that calls Azure Databricks as a compute resource.

At the end of this lad, you will have:

1. Explain how Azure Data Factory works
1. Azure Data Factory Components
1. Azure Data Factory and Databricks

## Exercise 1: Explain how Azure Data Factory works

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

Group exercise
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. From the case study and the scenario, identify the data stream ingestion technology for AdventureWorks, and the high-level tasks that you will conduct as a data engineer to complete the social media analysis requirements.

1. The instructor will discuss the findings with the group.

### Task 1: Identify the data requirements and structures of AdventureWorks.

1. From the lab virtual machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-200-Lab06-Ex01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.6** folder.

1. As a group, spend **10 minutes** discussing and listing the data requirements and data structure that your group has identified within the case study document.

### Task 2: Discuss the findings with the Instructor

1. The instructor will stop the group to discuss the findings.
